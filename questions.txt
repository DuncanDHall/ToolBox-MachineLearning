1. What is the general trend in the curve?
    It seems that the training percentage increases test accuracy with almost a 1:1 
    correlation.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
    The lower side of the curve seems to be more noisy, where there is a relatively
    small set of examples which control the "learning experience", if you will, and
    if these examples are biased at all, then that bias negatively influences
    learning.

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
    The correlation was exhibited clearly at 50 trials, though increasing trials from
    there still had significant smoothing effects (I ran up to 300 trials per test
    percentage)

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  
    That's pretty cool! It appears that the value for C detirmines how hard the 
    program thinks about it's examples, and how much time it puts in outside of
    class exploring and doing the "going beyond" challenges.
